"Referring to SCG’s testimony, page MFL-8, lines 9-19, please explain the reason for SCG’s request in filling two existing vacancies as SCG has already requested for two additional employees in Gas Acquisition on SCG’s testimony, SCG-09, page ITC-5, lines 20-21, in Sempra’s 2016 GRC, in which Gas Procurement O&M costs for two FTE vacancies were adopted in the last decision, D.16-06-054.","The two employee scheduling positions described in 2016 GRC Exhibit SCG-09, page ITC-5, lines 20-21 were requested as an incremental increase in FTEs for a FERC proposal to increase the number of gas nomination cycles and cycle deadlines (please see 2016 GRC Exhibit SCG-09, page ITC-5, lines 13-19). These two incremental positions were requested in addition to filling Gas Acquisition vacancies that existed when the labor forecast for GRC Test Year 2016 was prepared in 2014. GRC Test Year 2019 Exhibit SCG-16 supports labor forecasts for Gas Acquisition vacancies that existed at the end of Base Year 2016 for purposes of forecasting labor requirements for Test Year 2019. The vacancies described in SCG-16 testimony are not incremental and should be filled in order to meet Gas Acquisition priorities of providing reliable gas supplies to core customers at a low cost, and to lower customer carbon emission costs.",https://www.socalgas.com/regulatory/documents/a-17-10-008/ORA-DR-003_FH2_C_final_P.pdf,ORA-SCG-003-FH2
"Referring to SCG’s testimony, page MFL-8, lines 13-15, SoCalGas states, “We expect these vacancies to be filled by 2017 and have scheduled these vacancies to reflect the partial filling of existing vacancies in 2017 up to full staffing levels in 2018 and 2019.” Please indicate whether SoCalGas has filled, or partially filled, the existing vacancies in 2017. If yes, provide supporting documentation which reflects this and provides details such as when the vacancy was filled and at what annual salary. If no, explain why the full or partial filling of existing vacancies in 2017 has not occurred yet.","In 2017, an unexpected retirement and other internal Gas Acquisition employee movement resulted in the necessity to fill four key positions that became vacant. These positions are unrelated to the vacancies that existed during Base Year 2016. Because of the urgency to fill these positions to continue and support Gas Acquisition transactions and department goals, Gas Acquisition Management focused primarily on filling these key positions in 2017. As a result, the “two existing vacancies” described in Exhibit SCG-19, page MFL-8, line 13, have not yet been filled; however, Gas Acquisition Management intends on filling the two vacancies as soon as practicable.",https://www.socalgas.com/regulatory/documents/a-17-10-008/ORA-DR-003_FH2_C_final_P.pdf,ORA-SCG-003-FH2

Does SoCalGas currently have a long-term pipeline replacement program? Please provide a copy.,"SoCalGas objects to this question on the grounds that the phrase “long-term pipeline replacement program” is vague and ambiguous. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objection, SoCalGas responds as follows: Based on other questions in this data request set, SoCalGas interprets this request as seeking information related to Phase 1B of SoCalGas’ Pipeline Safety and Enhancement Plan (PSEP) and SoCalGas’ early vintage pipeline replacement program within its Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP). SoCalGas’ PSEP Amended Application and supporting testimony describing Phase 1B are attached. Available upon request are workpapers submitted in support of the Amended Application and Testimony. The workpapers include a list of pipelines and estimated costs associated with Phase 1B replacement work. Please note the current list of Phase 1B pipelines scheduled for replacement differs from that submitted in the 2011 PSEP Application as scope validation efforts have resulted in reduction of PSEP scope. This reduction will be accomplished through a reduction in the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure of certain pipelines or through abandonment of pipelines that are no longer required from an overall gas operating system perspective. Additionally, SoCalGas has a long-term replacement program for its early vintage steel and plastic (Aldyl-A) main and service pipelines, within its DIMP as discussed in Exhibit SCG-14. The proposed programs are wholesale replacement over the next 25-30 years, which utilize a relative risk model and dynamic segmentation to prioritize the replacement of poor performing segments. The proposed replacement program expands upon an existing early-vintage pipeline replacement program currently being implemented as part of DIMP. The early vintage plastic replacement program focuses on the replacement of Aldyl-A which exhibits brittle-like cracking characteristics. The brittle-like cracking characteristic could cause a leak on an early vintage plastic pipeline to grow and release additional natural gas than would normally be released, increasing the risk of natural gas gathering and igniting. Please see Ex. SCG-14, page 25 for additional details. The early vintage steel replacement program focuses on poor performing bare steel. The lack of protective coating makes steel a high-risk family of pipe and has been identified by DOT and PHMSA as a family of pipe that should be evaluated for an accelerated replacement program. Please see Ex. SCG-14, page 26 for additional details.",https://www.socalgas.com/regulatory/documents/a-17-10-008/OSA-SEU-005_Q1-6.pdf,OSA-SEU-005
"Around October 2017, SoCalGas experienced several pipeline outages near Newberry Springs. Please provide a copy of any preliminary root cause analyses (RCA) for the incidents.","SoCalGas experienced two pipelines outages near Newberry Springs in the Fall of 2017. One was a result of pipeline failure and the second due to the execution of remediation work on the other pipeline in the area due to external corrosion. SoCalGas is working with SED on the root cause analysis, a confidential version of which will be produced to SED in the future. Although the root cause, impact of the failure, and path forward are not within the scope of SoCalGas’ GRC Application, and the analysis will likely continue to be reviewed after the proceeding has concluded, SoCalGas proposes to take this opportunity to set up meetings with OSA, outside of the GRC, to discuss and provide updates on findings and next steps.

"On Page 29 of Exhibit SCG-14, Ms. Martinez stated the followings: Through the TIMP, SoCalGas continually evaluates the pipeline system and proactively takes action through inspections, replacements, and other remediation activities to improve the safety and reliability of the system. Please explain how SoCalGas has incorporated or will incorporate the information obtained from similar outages to “improve the safety and reliability of the system.","For purposes of this question, SoCalGas interprets the phrase “similar outages” to refer to the two pipeline outages referenced in Question 2 and OSA’s request for an explanation to refer to the incorporation of information into the Transmission Integrity Management Program (TIMP). The purpose of the TIMP is to continually identify threats on transmission pipelines, determine the risk posed by these threats, schedule assessments to address threats, collect information about the condition of the pipeline, and take actions to minimize applicable threats and integrity concerns to reduce the risk of a pipeline failure. When an area requires remediation, immediate attention based on assessment results, or a safety issue has been identified, prompt action is taken for the safety of the public and personnel working on the pipeline, which may include pressure reduction or removing pipelines from service until a repair can be completed. As noted in the response to Question 2, work on the root cause analysis of these outages, in coordination with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division (SED), is ongoing and is beyond the scope of the General Rate Case (GRC). The information obtained from the outages is incorporated into the TIMP continual assessment process described above, and the threats identified as part of these outages will be evaluated in order to determine assessment and remediation requirements to reduce the risk of a pipeline failure. Please see Exhibit SCG-14 on pages MTM-2 through MTM-3, and MTM-11 through MTM-13 for more details on the TIMP continual assessment and remediation process. It should also be noted that D.16-08-018 directs the utilities to “[r]espond to immediate or short-term crises outside of the RAMP and GRC process” because they “follow a three-year cycle and are not designed to address immediate needs.” (D.16-08-018 at 146).

Wildfire insurance forecast was based on anticipated insurance market conditions as of the October 6, 2017 GRC filing date. While not known at the time of our filing, the wildfires in PG&E’s service territory - which began on October 8, 2017 – will likely impact insurance pricing going forward. Marsh (Sempra’s insurance broker) provided an update on the California wildfire insurance market on November 1, 2017.1 In its November 1, 2017 update, Marsh suggests that wildfire insurance pricing could possibly increase 30% to 100% or more. Marsh also indicated that another significant wildfire involving a California Investor Owned Utility could further negatively impact pricing. The December wildfires in SCE’s service territory occurred after Marsh’s November 1, 2017 update; as such, we anticipate additional wildfire insurance availability challenges, which could result in increased wildfire insurance costs above Marsh’s November 1, 2017 guidance. The fact that the overall wildfire insurance market is seeing price increases is further reflected in a December 29, 2017 letter of notification SCE submitted to the Commission seeking to establishing a Z-Factor for costs associated with wildfire liability insurance costs. According to SCE, insurance prices have increased dramatically from what they had originally forecasted for 2018. Based on Marsh forecast and information outlined in the SCE letter, we are anticipating that wildfire insurance costs will be significantly higher than our forecasted amount outlined in our October 6, 2017 GRC filing.",https://www.socalgas.com/regulatory/documents/a-17-10-008/ORA-SDGESCG-ORAL-DR-002-LL%20Final.pdf,ORA-SEU-ORAL-002-LL

Provide proof the wildfire premiums are increasing.,"Sempra’s wildfire insurance premium are impacted by worldwide losses sustained by wildfire insurance carriers. As outlined in testimony (Ex. SCG-29-SDG&E-29) on page NKC – 14 lines 15 – 25 and page NKC – 15 lines 1- 2, Sempra’s wildfire insurance premiums were negatively impacted in 2016 by the Butte wildfire as Sempra did not have a wildfire insurance loss during that insurance policy period. As outlined in question 8, we are anticipating a significant increase in wildfire insurance costs above the forecasted costs provided as of our October 6, 2017 filing. Premiums will be known by the June 26, 2018 renewal date. The forecasts provided in testimony are built off of these assumptions. 2018 premiums will not be known until the June 26, 2018 renewal date. SCG and SDG&E believe the forecast in testimony represents the best projection for these costs at that time. My testimony supports the implementation of a balancing account to capture the actual costs of liability premiums for this reason.",https://www.socalgas.com/regulatory/documents/a-17-10-008/ORA-SDGESCG-ORAL-DR-002-LL%20Final.pdf,ORA-SEU-ORAL-002-LL
Page NKC-16 asks for a new balancing account. How were you paying for liability premiums previously? Why a two-way balancing account versus a one-way?,"Forecasts for insurance premiums are included in General Rate Case filings. The approved forecasted expenses are incorporated into a revenue requirement that is ultimately adopted in the GRC proceeding. That revenue is collected from ratepayers (with attrition in the post-test years) over the GRC cycle. SDG&E and SCG then pay for and expense actual liability insurance premiums as incurred during the GRC cycle and book them into FERC account 925. A two-way balancing account is proposed in this application “due to the uncertainty around the need for and the price of additional insurance and because of market fluctuations in the cost of liability insurance” (Ex. SCG-29/SDG&E-27, Page NKC-17 lines 1-3). As outlined in the testimony and further explained above in questions 8 & 11 of this data request, worldwide insurance losses directly impact Sempra’s insurance costs. Because of this, forecasting our insurance costs on a 3-year forward-looking basis is challenging. Accurately forecasting insurance losses and the resulting impacts to Sempra’s liability insurance costs is difficult. The cost volatility resulting from insurance market changes has the potential to be significant and have a major impact on the Utility’s overall costs. Since actual insurance premiums are influenced by insurance market cycles, a two-way balancing account is appropriate and fair to both ratepayers and the company. A one-way balancing account could impose an unreasonable cost responsibility on the company by impeding the recovery of costs that could be significantly greater than the forecast. Although the company has made every effort to forecast insurance premiums, based on information available at that time, it is reasonable to understand that insurance premiums cannot be accurately forecasted; particularly in California. A two-way balancing account would give the company the ability to continue to prudently procure insurance at levels commensurate to the underlying risk without being exposed to insurance market volatility that is beyond the company’s control. In both the two-way and one-way balancing account mechanisms, savings are returned to ratepayers on an annual basis, but given the potential volatility and magnitude of liability insurance costs, a two-way balancing account is fairer to both the company and ratepayers as insurance costs are influenced by insurance markets cycles that are beyond Sempra’s control. Ratepayers would pay for insurance premiums based on actual expenses and not on a forecast, which would be different (as explained above). To not allow a two-way balancing account mechanism would hold SDG&E and SCG financially accountable to insurance market volatility, which has the potential to be significant based on our latest insurance broker guidance (see question 8 response).",https://www.socalgas.com/regulatory/documents/a-17-10-008/ORA-SDGESCG-ORAL-DR-002-LL%20Final.pdf,ORA-SEU-ORAL-002-LL

SoCalGas’ testimony does not assert this. Further, the question is vague with respect to what is meant by the phrase “engineering study.” For purposes of preparing this response, SoCalGas interprets the phrase “engineering study” to generally encompass certain, but not all, preconstruction activities including, but not limited to, the following: development of a detailed scope of work, cost estimate and schedule, an engineering review of the natural gas distribution system to determine system impacts, identification of distribution taps to allow continuity of natural gas service, the preparation of detailed engineered drawings and material lists, the identification and preparation of ministerial permits, the identification of land requirements and ownership, the preparation of land documents for the acquisition of property, the identification of environmental permits, and environmental compliance and mitigation activities. SoCalGas further interprets the phrase “engineering study” to exclude land right and material acquisition costs. With this clarification, SoCalGas responds as follows: In A.13-12-013, SoCalGas presented a cost estimate for “engineering study” type activities for a Moreno-to-Whitewater pipeline project. The scope of a pipeline project to relocate a pipeline around the Morongo reservation is anticipated to be similar in scope and location to the Morenoto-Whitewater project presented in A.13-12-013. The “engineering study” costs associated with that project were estimated to be approximately $10 million in 2013 dollars. Considering escalation, the estimate of “engineering study” costs of a relocation project to avoid the Morongo reservation could be higher.",https://www.socalgas.com/regulatory/documents/a-17-10-008/TURN-SCGC-DR-09_Final.pdf,TURN-SCGC-SEU-009

"At Page 7 of the March 8, 2017 Staff Report on Risk and Safety Aspects of Risk Assessment and Mitigation Phase Report of San Diego Gas & Electric Company and Southern California Gas Company, Investigation 16-10-015 and I.16-10-016, Staff state: The following should be considered for improvement in the GRC presentation and workpapers: • In the RSE, use plausible comparisons that connect causal relationships to information provided for making a sound decision on whether the increase in spending would be reasonable and the incident rate reductions possible. • More thoroughly outline plans for enhancing existing mitigations, and provide more information to sufficiently describe how enhancements differ and improve baseline (Control) activities with an estimate of risk reduction. • Improve the correlation of the RSE to the baseline risks and the proposed risk mitigations in order for the RSE to be used as intended. • Address the requirement to provide an RSE for the alternative mitigation programs, and work on presenting reasonable and viable alternatives and provide sufficient explanation of alternatives and their potential for risk reduction. The testimony of Diana Day discusses the Staff Report. Please provide further citations to testimony that demonstrates how SoCalGas incorporated these suggestions in the following chapters: a. SCG-05 Gas System Integrity- Omar Rivera b. SCG-06 Gas Transmission Operation- Elizabeth Musich c. SCG-07 Gas Transmission- Elizabeth Musich d. SCG-09 Underground Storage- Neil Navin e. SCG-14 Pipeline Integrity for Transmission and Distribution – Maria Martinez","SoCalGas notes that while subpart d of this question references Exhibit SCG-09, an email communication from Katy Morsony, received on June 27, 2018, clarified the requested information is for Exhibit SCG-10, Underground Storage. Accordingly, SoCalGas’ response pertains to Exhibit SCG-10, rather than Exhibit SCG-09. The first, third, and fourth bullets listed in the quote above from the SED Evaluation Report on the Companies’ RAMP filing address improvements related to Risk Spend Efficiency (RSE). As explained in Ms. Day’s revised direct testimony (Exhibit SCG-02-R/SDG&E-02-R) at DD-17-18, the Companies did not include RSE calculations in this current GRC given that they are “evolving, should be further refined in the S-MAP, and have limited usefulness in their current state.” Therefore, Exhibits SCG-05, SCG-06, SCG-07, SCG-10, and SCG-14 do not discuss RSE calculations. However, these five SoCalGas exhibits do describe, both through narrative and tables, the controls (2016 costs) and mitigations (estimated TY 2019 incremental), as applicable, related to RAMP. Further, SoCalGas explains in narrative how the mitigation activities relate to the RAMP risks. In addition to the relevant workpapers, below are citations for each of the requested SoCalGas testimony exhibits: a. SCG-05 at Section I.B, Section II, and the cost sections (non-shared and shared O&M) such as Section III.A. b. SCG-06 at Section I.D, Section II, and Section III.D. c. SCG-07 at Section I.C, Section II, and the capital cost sections such as Sections III.B, E, and G. d. SCG-10 at Section I.B, Section II, Section III. A, B, D and the capital cost sections such as Section V.C, D, F, and G. e. SCG-14 at Section I.B, Section II, and the cost sections (non-shared, shared, and capital) such as Section III.B. As of the date of this data request, there is a S-MAP settlement agreement pending before the Commission; one term of that settlement agreement would result in the further refinement of the RSE, which can be presented at the next GRC.
